**Introduction**

In this project, we are going to work on a dataset contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey. What features are highly correlated to a satisfied (or dissatisfied) passenger? Can you predict passenger satisfaction?

the aim of this project is to build a classification model to determine whether the airline passengers are satisfied or not and see if it gives us a good accuracy or not.

**Data Description:**

- We will use dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- the dataset contains 129880 rows and 25 columns

**Features:**

- _ **Gender** __:_ Gender of the passengers (Female, Male)
- _ **Customer** __**Type**__ :_ The customer type (Loyal customer, disloyal customer)
- _ **Age** __:_ The actual age of the passengers
- _ **Type** __**of Travel**__ :_ Purpose of the flight of the passengers (Personal Travel, Business Travel)
- _ **Class** __:_ Travel class in the plane of the passengers (Business, Eco, Eco Plus)
- _ **Flight distance** __:_ The flight distance of this journey
- _ **Inflight wifi service** __:_ Satisfaction level of the inflight wifi service (0:Not Applicable;1-5)
- _ **Departure/Arrival time convenient** __:_ Satisfaction level of Departure/Arrival time convenient
- _ **Ease of Online booking** __:_ Satisfaction level of online booking
- _ **Gate location:** _ Satisfaction level of Gate location
- _ **Food and drink** __:_ Satisfaction level of Food and drink
- _ **Online boarding** __:_ Satisfaction level of online boarding
- _ **Seat comfort** __:_ Satisfaction level of Seat comfort

- _ **Departure Delay in Minutes** __:_ Minutes delayed when departure
- _ **Arrival Delay in Minutes** __:_ Minutes delayed when Arrival

**Target:**

- _ **Satisfaction** __:_ Airline satisfaction level(Satisfaction, neutral or dissatisfaction)

**Goal:**

- Determine which features are highly correlated to a satisfied.
- Build a classification model to predict passenger satisfaction.
- Choose the model that give us the best predict.
